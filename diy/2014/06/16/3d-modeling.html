                    <p>Myself with couple of other folks from our office helped Redd technologies organized a one day 3D printing workshop in our office
premises. After some delay because of the Ascendas security in getting the printers in, we had an interesting session which discussed
about the concepts behind 3D models design and a hands-on with some of the tools that can be used to come up with our own designs.</p>

<p>After messing around with the tool called <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a> for 4-5 hours, I was finally able to create what was in my
mind...</p>
