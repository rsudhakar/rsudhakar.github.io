        <div class="post">
            <p>I am always interested in designing floor plans. Plans that utilize every square feet efficiently and artistically. It took
me 4 months to finalized my home&#39;s plan with an architect and at the end of it he even got operated for some problem
in his skull (hopefully I am not the reason for it). It is a rectangular plot of 60 X 40 feet and the design
was for a duplex house with spacious drawing room, open kitchen and 4 bed rooms. Pretty usual stuff...</p>

<p>I recently encountered a strange looking land in my neighbourhood. By strange I mean, the plot is not a rectangle but a quadrilateral
with only vertex having 90 degree. I started to think whether it be possible to come up with an effective floor plan for such
a plot and started playing using a software tool call sweet home 3d.</p>

<p>And, I am pretty satisfied with the results...</p>

<p>What you see on the top is two single BHK houses with separate balcony. Even thought the plan looks like square wave on one side,
 no single room will have a discontinuous wall.</p>
