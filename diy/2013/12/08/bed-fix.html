                <p>How can a bed design be described as &quot;ill&quot;? If it makes you ill then we can very well say it is ill</p>

<p>How can a bed make someone ill? If it caves in the middle due to the body weight and does not support you back to stay flat, It can make anyone&#39;s back ill</p>

<p>That is what exactly happened to me and my wife. We first thought of it to be the problem with the coir mattress and bought ourselves a more
traditional cotton mattress with no use. After repeated suffering for a couple of months, we called the cotton mattress maker complaining
about his bad mattress which did not last even for 3 months.</p>

<p>Impossible! Was his response along with &#39;the problem could be with the way you use or with your bed itself&#39;. And I was wondering what else might he say if
I continue to listen to his analysis-over-the-phone debriefing... may be the vaasthu of our bedroom / bed sheet that we use???</p>

<p>Anyways he agreed to give a visit and diagnose the problem. And, When he visited, Within minutes of his inspection, he demonstrated how bad our bed is designed.</p>

<p>It is a ready-made wooden moulded assembled bed I bought from <a href="http://www.homecentrestores.com/en/product/beds">Home Center</a>.
I was not able to believe that I was deceived by the showrooms looks and had not given a second thought on the quality of furniture they sell :(</p>

<p>I was not ready to throw away the whole because of the problem with the part. Instead of trying to find a carpenter, I decided to
give it a shot and was very much happy with the results :)</p>
