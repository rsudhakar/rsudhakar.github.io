            <p>Ever tried concrete work? It was great fun playing with it under the sun!</p>

<p>We had installed cast iron spiral stairs in our house from first floor to the terrace. They need to be
screwed to the iron bars of the concrete floor which involves chipping away the floor to reach them.
Once the installation was complete, I took the task of filling it back to make it look as usual (well, not exactly)</p>

<p>I should say I am pretty happy with the outcome... Only the paint job was pending to make it look perfect...</p>
