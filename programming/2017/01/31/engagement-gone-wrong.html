            <p>Problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Started an engagement with scope definition at very high level (one liners)</li>
<li>SOW was not signed by both the parties before starting the work</li>
<li>The disagreement started from week 1 about what is in scope vs what is not in scope</li>
<li>Both the parties stayed on their ground in defining what they think is the scope of work</li>
<li>Work is pretty complex as it has GoLang, Elixir, Docker, Rails </li>
<li>Exisiting code is legacy code base (has no test coverage) and is a bastard child of SOA, Monolith</li>
<li>4 devs took up the task of building 2 web apps which usually will be done by a team of 1 BA (shared), 2 QAs, 5/6 Devs, 1 DevOps</li>
<li>Fixed bid engagement (2 months)</li>
<li>Scope creep left, right &amp; center. To be fair, there is no well defined scope to start with which hid the creep very easily</li>
<li>Assumption of client going to do the work of QA is a big mistake</li>
<li>Almost every defect is seen as critical and was used as reasons to hold payments / to build perception that app is not working</li>
<li>Clients did not understand agile way of working. It was always they needed everything in the huge excel list (which are all one liners) 
in the fixed bid engagement within the given time frame</li>
</ul>

<h2>- Deployment was time consuming as there is no automation</h2>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<h2>- Devs learned Elixir, GoLang</h2>

<p>Notes just for me:</p>

<p>Vagmi is not interested in fixing their existing rails app. But, what they wanted was exactly that. The excel they had 90% of stuff 
that is broken in their existing rails family of apps (mgmt, account, billing, sms). So, somewhere before start of the engagement, to 
get the project, they orally agreed to get what they want done</p>
