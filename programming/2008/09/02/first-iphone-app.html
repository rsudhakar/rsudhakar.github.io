                <p>Well well…. It is really a great experience to soak my feet in iPhone programming…
But, after 3 hours of playing with Objective-C and Cocoa, I was able to get some very simple and completely useless app to work…
It does nothing other than displaying a text on button click… Sounds silly right? Yes i know…
But, for a java programmer who had never touched Objective-C and Cocoa, I think this as an achievement! :)</p>

<p>Apple’s architecture of keeping UIComponents (xib files) and the operations (on it) separate is good… I can design application screens (in Interface Builder) and write functions in Objective-C independently and then associate them later. This way, there is a lot of scope for reuse… However, this mapping part is bit tricky… It took me some time to understand Outlets and Actions…</p>

<p>There is a loooooooooooooong way from here to my first useful application “Time Tracker” and I hope I will be able to do it in a month’s time given my busy schedule ![;)][5]</p>

<p>Following sites were very helpful for me in understanding the basics of Objective-C and Cocoa…</p>

<li> <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/">http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/</a>  (This is a great site for someone like me who is completely new to Objective-C and know Object oriented concepts)</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?FirstResponder">http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?FirstResponder</a> (Got good info about FirstResponder)</li>
<li> Apple Cocoa and Objective-C documents (These are pretty dull and boring... was not able to continue reading it without falling asleep.. So, i went directly into coding instead of spending much time on these)</li>
