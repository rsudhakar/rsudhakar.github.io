                    <p>Ok, you got an iPhone when it was in version 1.1.1 and, when there was a possibility of unlocking it, you did it… But,
Apple did not stop there… they kept adding more features to it and dammit, you cannot run automatic updates for it and keep
it unlocked… like me, if you were also praying for some great soul to come and rescue your iPhone, good news… our prayers are answered…
and that great soul is zibri Ok… enough of my *#@$% let me scrap how I did it so it might help others…</p>

<p>This whole unlocked iPhone upgrading process is so easy even a caveman can do it. Don’t believe me? Check it out…</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>ziphone software</strong>: Downloaded it <a href="http://www.downloadziphone.org/">here</a> and zibri’s blog is <a href="http://www.ziphone.org/">here</a></li>
<li><strong>1.1.4 firmware file</strong>: This link is present in ziphone software. After extracting the executable zip file downloaded from above step, I opened ZiphoneGUI.exe and clicked on “Help &amp; Info” button in the right side. This help window has “Web links” section containing links for all the firmware versions. Downloaded 1.1.4 from it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was aware that I will lose all the data in my phone. As expected, All the contacts, apps, calendar, notes, music, and every other things I dumped in were lost after the update. iTunes ‘sync to computer’ saved my day.</p>

<p>Firmware update steps (For out of the box 1.1.4 iPhones brought recently, I would have started from step 7):</p>

<ol>
<li>Switched off my iPhone (hold the sleep/wake button)</li>
<li>Started in restore mode (kept holding the home button and connected it to the computer)</li>
<li>iTunes opened and displayed my phone with restore option… Clicked on the restore button by holding down the shift key to open the file browser… Selected the downloaded 1.1.4 firmware file</li>
<li>iTunes did its ‘thing’ to restore the phone to 1.1.4 firmware</li>
<li>After successful completion of the above step, My iPhone restarted automatically to show iTunes with welcome screen to activate it through AT&amp;T (ya right… I was going to do it )</li>
<li>Disconnected the phone and closed iTunes. Also killed the background process iTunesHelper.exe</li>
<li>For the second time, I connected my iPhone to the computer in restore mode</li>
<li>Opened ZiPhoneGUI.exe and clicked on “Do it all!” button</li>
<li>Was relaxing for around 4 mins by looking at the wonders zibri software did to my phone. (you can see it on the phone screen… ya… iPhone-only-understood-rolling-text)</li>
<li>Zibri software window displayed success message</li>
<li>Phone restarted and iTunes listed it with setup screen to set the name and configuration type. I selected option saying something like “Set up as a new phone”. – There seems to be some weird problems with the other option.</li>
</ol>

<p>At last, I was able to try out some of the new iPhone features and looks pretty cool than the you tube video demos. Also, donated some money to zibri (through his blog site) supporting his work….</p>
