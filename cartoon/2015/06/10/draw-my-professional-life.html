                    <p>One of the bad parts of conducting technical interviews is going through the candidates resumes. The more
experienced they are, the more painful it is because of the unwritten rule that every couple more years of experience
should lead to an extra page. Sure they have done lot of work so, they feel &quot;Let me put everything and the readers
pick what they want&quot;. Going through all the pages to hunt for the information that really matters to us is not
only time consuming but also annoying.</p>

<p>If I put myself in their shoes, What can I do different? Can I make my resume readers life any better? The more I
 thought about it, the more I felt the medium we use is the problem. The medium I mean here is the text. If I draw my whole
 resume like RSA Animate, will it tell my professional story better?</p>
