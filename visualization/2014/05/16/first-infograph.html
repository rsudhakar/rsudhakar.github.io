            <p>Here is my first stab at creating an infograph. Took nearly 2 hours to get comfortable with the <a href="http://piktochart.com/">piktochart</a> editor and create it.
I should say piktochart is very powerful in getting the data easily visualized with its chart selector.
There are quite a lot of different options like Swatch, Icon Matrix along with the usual line, bar, pie, doughnut charts in the free version.</p>

<p>Also, their icon collection is very nice. Was able to find some icons where even the <a href="http://iconfinder.com">iconfinder</a> failed me.</p>

<p>I did this to raise funds for setting up a small library of good books for a home in pallavaram called Baba Gurukulam</p>
