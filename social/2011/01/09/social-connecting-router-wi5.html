                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="post">
                <p>As you might have heard <a href="http://www.wi5.in/">Zylog Wi5</a> is a wireless broadband service available in many Indian cities.
Even though it is wireless, they will install a small signal receiver (modem + router) in the home roof tops for better signal reception.
If you already have a home router to connect all your internet hungry devices, you might be perplexed as how to make them work together.
Here is how the situation looks…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/wi5connection.png" alt="Wi5 to local router connection"></p>

<p>The following instructions will help you to make it happen. What we are trying to do is connecting a router to another router…</p>

<p><strong>Wi5 WLAN Router:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you are able to connect to the internet directly without your router in the picture</li>
<li>Open the Wi5 router’s admin page (192.168.1.254 by default)</li>
<li>Go to the LAN Interface under TCP/IP settings and make sure DHCP server is set in server mode</li>
<li>Updated DHCP client range wide enough based on how many devices you want to connect to your home router</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Home Wireless Router:</strong></p>

<p>Almost all the routers will have atleast 4 LAN ports to connect other devices to the network and a separate LAN port for connecting the ISP’s modem. Since Wi5 does not actually have a separate modem but instead is a modem%2Brouter, how you connect the both is bit different…</p>

<ol>
<li>Connect the Wi5 router to your home router in one of the 4 LAN sockets</li>
<li>Login to your home router and disable its DHCP server. There can be only one DHCP server in a network and since we have enabled Wi5 router’s DHCP server, this is not needed.</li>
<li>Restart the router if needed/prompted</li>
</ol>

<p>This should do.</p>
