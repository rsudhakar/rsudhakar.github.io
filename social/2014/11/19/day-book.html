                <p>First step to learn from your past is to record it in a way that is easy to look back and make inferences. Zeroth step is to build a tool to do it</p>

<p>Now, which is hard? First step or the Zeroth step?</p>

<p>On first thought, Step zero sounds hard and on second thought, step zero sounds unnecessary to achieve the first step. 
Why do we have digital diaries for? Why not use a simple note taking app with feature to search across notes taken everyday? </p>

<p>So I started to record the important things (related to what I wanted to improve on) in a digital note taking app that creates a new page everyday.
One month passed, Two months passed, six months passed before I knew it. Awesome I thought to myself and started my half-yearly review
process... Hmmm where to start with? I cannot read all the 6 months contents... Well lemme just skim through looking for a specific
topic in my notes, here it is, move on, more of it here and more there... great now what do I infer from it? nothing much. 
May be I should have reviewed it more frequently to realise that I have not made much progress. 
Hmmmm, but it is not efficient to read through like this multiple times for 
every topic / theme that is surfacing... </p>

<p>Aaaah... Now I understand the importance of step zero... What will help me to look back pretty much every week for all the topics atleast to
realize that I have not done much for some. I went into the cave and meditated for nearly 2 months to come out with <a href="https://day-book.github.io/">this!</a> </p>
