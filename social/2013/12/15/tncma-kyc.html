            <p>TamilNadu Government conducted hackathon event in Anna University for all the software enthusiasts. Myself along with 4
other thoughtworkers participated and built an app prototype that eventually emerged as one of the winners.</p>

<p>We named the app as KYC (abbreviation for Know Your City) which is an overlay of all the entities controlled by the municipality
over an open sourced map with options to add/edit/modify existing entities.</p>

<p>Almost two days of mucking around with leaflet.js and its plug-ins resulted in an app to showcase our idea...</p>

<p>Play around by disabling/enabling the overlays on the right &amp; drag dropping the new entities from the left pane on the map</p>
